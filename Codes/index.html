	<article class="trait" aria-labelledby="t3"><h3 id="t3">Mentor</h3><p>Skrillex, also known as Sonny Moore, is a genuine role model who proved that true artistry means never settling into one lane. His drastic switch from being a post-hardcore frontman to a global electronic dance music pioneer taught me that it’s okay to completely reinvent yourself and follow where your passion leads, even if it surprises everyone. Watching him master sound design inspired me to pursue my passion for bass guitar right after discovering my gift for playing the piano and pushing my own creative boundaries. His legendary career showcases the fact that you do not need to do things the normal way or to mimic what others are doing to produce great results. "Obstacles are an opportunity to create something new"- Skrillex.</p></article>

      <h2 id="ai-heading">AI Businesses of 2025: AI-powered virtual assistance</h2>
      <p class="report-text">I chose AI-powered virtual assistance because it can be applied in education and small organisations to automate routine tasks, provide student support, and assist teachers with their administrative work. Ethical concerns may include privacy and data security. My solution for this would be clear privacy policies and human oversight for important decisions. An example of an app in this area is Google's Assistant (https://assistant.google.com).</p>

      <h2 id="personal-devlopment-heading">Personal Development</h2>
      <p class="report-text"> <li>Chapter 4 emphasizes that true success requires an active commitment to lifelong learning. The main character, Michael, learns that he must consistently dedicate time to reading, listening to educational materials, and studying people who have already achieved success, as this input is the foundation for creating a rich future.</li>
	<li>Chapter 5: The Pillar of Discipline
	Discipline is presented as the essential trait that closes the gap between simply      having goals and actually achieving them. Michael discovers the power of small, repeated acts of self-control, realizing that the courage to manage your daily routine is the single biggest factor determining your long-term results. </li>
	<li>Chapter 6: The Pillar of Wealth
This chapter lays out a simple but powerful strategy for achieving financial freedom by urging Michael to pay himself first. The primary lesson is that true wealth is secured by a disciplined commitment to saving and wisely investing a percentage of every dollar earned, thereby ensuring his future prosperity.</li>
	<li>Chapter 7: The Pillar of Health
This chapter reveals that health is the most valuable asset upon which all other success is built. Michael discovers the importance of taking excellent care of his body through proper diet, regular exercise, and adequate rest, recognizing that physical energy directly impacts his ability to achieve his goals.<li></p></section>
